# BatToExeDecrypter
This script can grab any Bat2Exe original code and give it to you

It's opens-ource so you can edit the directories in case it fails to you because of this, or update in case there is a Bat2Exe program that can bypass this script

# Usage
1) Start the script
2) Run the program 
3) See how the source code appeared in front of you :)

# Warning
This script deletes all the batches in Temp folder before running it! It will automatically generate and copy the batches that were already in temp on your desktop in  a folder called BackUpBatches, but only batches...not directories at all

# Enjoy!
